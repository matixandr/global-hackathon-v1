# Procrastination App

## About The Project

This is an Android application designed to help users combat procrastination. The app allows users to select a list of distracting applications and set a timer. Once the timer is started, the selected applications will be blocked for the duration of the timer. This helps users to stay focused on their tasks without getting distracted by social media, games, or other applications.

## Features
